# OracleDatabaseProject
This was a project where we learned how to create an oracle Database based on an real invoice and dummy data we would create.
The final deliverable was a book containing all the inserts, ERD's, instance charts, Normalization steps, etc.
The scope of the project included sorts, subsets, joins among other SQL functions.
